FFMpeg for Cedrus on Allwinner devices with sunxi kernel Based on increadible work with jemk and alcantor, we managed to update FFmpeg to include cedrus264 hardware encoder. Now it encodes I and P frames, and support resolutions up to 1080p

To us it, clone the repository, and configure by:

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-vdpau --enable-libx264 --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libpulse --enable-libv4l2

and then, make && make install

Alternatively, you can install "checkinstall" package on your target, and create a deb package for easy distribution.

You may download my deb package here also.
